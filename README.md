## Introduction

FlameCMS is a *MMORPG* Framework based in PHP & HTML.

It is a newly made from scratch Content Management System so that the members
can register and manage their accounts and so that they Administrator can
administer his Site with ease.
It is based on the code of the previous project with extensive changes over time 
to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the 
CMS mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
